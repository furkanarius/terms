' \n' + 
'**Mysterium Node Runner (the “Pilot”) description** \n' + 
' \n' + 
'This Pilot is an internal test that we are running with the purpose of gathering data on our network, users and incentive structures. It consists of onboarding both node runners and traffic providers on the Mysterium Network and analysing a set of performance metrics. \n' + 
' \n' + 
'We will gradually onboard a certain number of nodes who have been pre-screened through a questionnaire, and we will give them the performance requirements. We will simultaneously push traffic through these nodes to analyse node behavior and overall network health. If the requirements are met, the nodes will receive compensation for participating in the Pilot subject to the terms below. We will be monitoring their bandwidth performance to ensure that they are meeting our requirements, and should they fall outside of the given metrics, they will not receive compensation. \n' + 
' \n' + 
'Throughout the length of the Pilot, we reserve the right to make any changes to the metrics we follow in order to assess the network in a manner that we see fit. We will inform you as soon as any changes are made to the node runner requirements so you can adjust accordingly. \n' + 
' \n' + 
'We cannot ensure that all or any of the participating nodes in the Pilot will continue to be used in our network once the Pilot ends. Below you will find the general terms and conditions that you will have to accept in order to continue with the Pilot. \n' +
